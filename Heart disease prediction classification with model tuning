AIM. : Heart disease prediction classification with model tuning.

Introduction;
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project repository. This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It involves data analysis, data preprocessing, and the application of machine learning models to make predictions

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can help identify individuals at a higher risk of heart disease. By analyzing a dataset of health parameters, we aim to build accurate models that can assist in early detection and intervention.

Brief Description of the Project:
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing various health parameters and a binary classification task to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals. The project consists of the following major steps:

    3. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
    4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
    5. Feature selection and handling multicollinearity.
    6. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    7. Hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models.
    8. Model training and evaluation using three different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    7. Model training and evaluation.
    8. Display of confusion matrices and classification reports for model performance.

Brief Description and Insight:
This project aims to identify early indicators of heart disease by analyzing various health parameters. It involves data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides valuable insights into the dataset, enabling us to make informed decisions regarding feature selection and model training.

The feature selection process involves considering parameters with significant influence on heart disease prediction and handling multicollinearity to ensure model accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the machine learning models' performance.

Three modelling procedures are employed in this project:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A widely used classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a binary outcome. Logistic Regression is used to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The model is trained with hyperparameters optimized through grid search.
2. **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured model that makes decisions based on the input features. A Decision Tree model is employed for heart disease prediction. The model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned for optimal performance.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It is used for heart disease prediction. The model's hyperparameters are optimized through grid search.

  Conclusion :
This project combines data analysis and machine learning to address the critical issue of heart disease prediction. By following the steps outlined in this repository, you can gain insights into the dataset, select the most relevant features, and create predictive models that aid in early detection and intervention for heart disease.
