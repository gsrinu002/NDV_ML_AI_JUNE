Problem Statement :
To create a dashboard that provides a clear overview of sales performance enabling owner to gain actionable insights.

Sections in the Report
Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :

Report data can be sliced by a quarter of the year to show the data of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

Report data can also be sliced by state to show sales of any particular state.

Report has cards showing Total Amount, Total Profit, Total Quantity of Sale.

Report has a bar chart showing Total Profit by Month.

I conditionally formatted the bar chart to show different color in case of profit and loss in the business.

Report has another horizontal bar chart which shows Profit by Sub Category of Items.

I have included a donut chart to show the quantity of products ordered through different payment mode.

I also included a donut chart to show the quantity of products ordered in which category.

Then I included a horizontal bar chart to show top 4 performing state in sales.

And lastly, I included a bar chart to show top 4 customers of our store.

I have also included a Reset button at the top to clear all slicer's.

To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset all the slicer's.
